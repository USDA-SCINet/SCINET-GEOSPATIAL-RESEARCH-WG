# Symposium
<br>
### Challenges and opportunities in leveraging machine learning techniques to further sustainable and intensified agriculture

**9/1/2020, 11am-2pm MDT**

**Registration Required:** [https://www.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJIscO-gqzwqHIbg_hUB-6vHosTYeDjjS_Y](https://www.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJIscO-gqzwqHIbg_hUB-6vHosTYeDjjS_Y)

The 2020 SCINet Geospatial Workshop concludes with a symposium showcasing four invited speakers, each giving a 30-minute presentation on how they use machine learning for agricultural research. 

Following the presentations, a panel discussion will address the following questions as well as questions from the audience:
- What are the merits and pitfalls of machine learning techniques in comparison to traditional deterministic (physical/process-based) and probabilistic modeling/analysis for agricultural research?
- The USDA ARS is currently undergoing an effort to increase/improve the computational and machine learning capabilities across the agency. What are the skillsets that are required to conduct research with “big data” using machine learning techniques? Do you have suggestions on the best approaches for developing these skillsets?
- What do you see as the future directions for machine learning and advanced computing techniques (e.g. cloud, HPC) in agricultural research?

**Title**: How to use statistical data to train classifiers

**Abstract**: The presentation is about a new possibility brought by deep learning in the field of cropland classification, which is covered in a recent article "Deep learning based winter wheat mapping using statistical data as ground references in Kansas and northern Texas, US" published in Remote Sensing of Environment. In the study, the deep neural network classifier was trained using per-county wheat acreage by USDA and MODIS image series, and the trained classifier predicted per-pixel wheat map without relying on county statistics in the target year.

**Title:** Characterizing field-scale soil moisture dynamics with big data and machine learning: challenges and opportunities for digital agriculture

**Abstract:** Knowledge of soil moisture dynamics at the field scale is essential for agricultural management such as irrigation and fertilization scheduling. However, soil moisture varies greatly in space and time. Neither in situ soil moisture sensor networks nor satellite remote sensing platforms can be directly used to guide field-scale agricultural management. Compared to mechanistic and statistical methods, machine learning models have recently shown the potential to leverage big data from remote sensing and in situ soil sensor network measurements and high-resolution land surface parameters for mapping and forecasting soil moisture dynamics at the field, regional, and global scales. Future work is required to improve the machine learning models (e.g. transferability, interpretability), integrate soil moisture forecasts into decision-support systems (e.g. cost-benefit analysis, economic and environmental trade-offs), and enhance cyberinfrastructure (e.g. FAIR principles) for sustainable and intensified agricultural production.
