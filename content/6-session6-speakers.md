**Title:** Predicting rangeland fractional cover for the western U.S. with random forests and multitask learning

**Abstract:** Capitalizing on over 52,000 on-the-ground vegetation plots we trained two machine learning style models to predict plant functional type fractional cover across western U.S. rangelands, annually from 1984-present. Random Forests provided the initial fractional cover product which we recently improved upon by using multi-task learning in temporal convolutional networks. The pros and cons of the two methods will be discussed as well as the multiple applications of the resulting fractional land cover products.

**Title:** How to use statistical data to train classifiers

**Abstract:** The presentation is about a new possibility brought by deep learning in the field of cropland classification, which is covered in a recent article "Deep learning based winter wheat mapping using statistical data as ground references in Kansas and northern Texas, US" published in Remote Sensing of Environment. In the study, the deep neural network classifier was trained using per-county wheat acreage by USDA and MODIS image series, and the trained classifier predicted per-pixel wheat map without relying on county statistics in the target year.

**Title:** UAV-satellite spatio-temporal data fusion and deep learning for yield prediction

**Abstract:** In this work, we present a concept of UAV and satellite spatio-temporal data fusion for crop monitoring, specifically plant phenotyping and yield prediction. We show that (1) spatial-temporal data fusion from airborne and satellite systems provide effective means for capturing early stress; (2) UAV data can complement the limitations of satellite remote sensing data for field-level crop monitoring, addressing not just mixed pixel issues but also filling the temporal gap in satellite data availability; and (3) spatial-temporal gap-filling enables predicting yield more accurately using data collected at optimal growth stages (e.g., seed filling stage). The concept developed in this paper also provides a framework for accurate and robust estimation of plant traits and grain yield and delivers valuable insight for high spatial precision in high-throughput phenotyping and farm field management.

**Title:** Characterizing field-scale soil moisture dynamics with big data and machine learning: challenges and opportunities for digital agriculture

**Abstract:** Knowledge of soil moisture dynamics at the field scale is essential for agricultural management such as irrigation and fertilization scheduling. However, soil moisture varies greatly in space and time. Neither in situ soil moisture sensor networks nor satellite remote sensing platforms can be directly used to guide field-scale agricultural management. Compared to mechanistic and statistical methods, machine learning models have recently shown the potential to leverage big data from remote sensing and in situ soil sensor network measurements and high-resolution land surface parameters for mapping and forecasting soil moisture dynamics at the field, regional, and global scales. Future work is required to improve the machine learning models (e.g. transferability, interpretability), integrate soil moisture forecasts into decision-support systems (e.g. cost-benefit analysis, economic and environmental trade-offs), and enhance cyberinfrastructure (e.g. FAIR principles) for sustainable and intensified agricultural production.
