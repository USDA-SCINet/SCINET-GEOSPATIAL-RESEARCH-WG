## Details on the Upcoming 2020 Sessions
The following links will take to you to our workshop homepage where you can register for each session if you haven't already. 

If you are unable to join a session, you will still be able to access and work through all the tutorials on your own using the session tabs at the top of our [workshop homepage](https://kerriegeil.github.io/SCINET-GEOSPATIAL-RESEARCH-WG/). We will also eventually make the Zoom recordings available as well.

**Preparation for the tutorial sessions (2, 3, 4, 5)**

The most important item is **make sure you can successfully login to your SCINet account** before (preferably days before) the tutorials start. There are many tutorial registrants with expired passwords that may need assistance from the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) if old passwords have been forgotten. If it's your first time logging in, use the [Quick Start Guide](https://scinet.usda.gov/guide/quickstart) and if you are still having trouble and contact the VRSC for help scinet_vrsc@usda.gov.

Try to **set yourself up on a large monitor** or Google how to connect your laptop to your tv. Ideally, you will want enough screen space to have a side by side set up where one side is the live Zoom session and the other side you can have JupyterLab open in a browser window so you can work through the tutorials in real time. This set up is nearly impossible on a laptop screen alone.

If you plan to follow along with the Git/Github portion of the Session 4 Tutorial: Computational Reproducibility Tools, **[Create a free personal Github account](https://github.com/join)**.  Make sure you remember your Github username and password.

Lastly, visit the [premeeting page](https://kerriegeil.github.io/SCINET-GEOSPATIAL-RESEARCH-WG/content/0-PreMeeting.html) to **familiarize yourself with the software/HPC terminology that will be used** in the tutorial sessions.


### Other Upcoming Activities of the Working Group

We're planning to hold a working group Zoom session quarterly at minimum (monthly if we have enough content ideas). The sessions could be research presentations from inside or outside ARS, short tutorials or demonstrations of software or computational techniques, and presentations such as how to design collaborative research, how to make better scientific figures/presentations, HPC etiquette, etc. We will also have sessions on our ongoing projects such as the SCINet common data library and the geospatial workbook.

**Discussion Question: What content would you like to see in quarterly working group meetings?**

## Introduction to the SCINet Postdocs

The first cohort of postdocs funded by the SCINet Computing Initiative has arrived at ARS! Here is a short introduction to everyone.

#### Melanie Kammerer Allen, 

#### Ibukun (Timothy) Ayankojo,

#### Jennifer Chang,

#### Alicia Foxx, 

#### Kerrie Geil, climate scientist
![picture of kerrie](/images/postdoc-pics/kerrie-geil-150-150.jpg)

Kerrie served as a AAAS Policy Fellow at USDA ARS in Beltsville MD from 2018-2020 and has recently transitioned in July to a SCINet Postdoc position in Las Cruces, NM in the research group of Dr. Deb Peters. She received her PhD in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Arizona in 2016 and her research background is in global and regional climate modeling and climate model performance evaluation using in-situ and satellite observations. Kerrie has expertise in global-, continental-, and regional- scale climate dynamics including teleconnections/climate oscillations (ENSO, PDO, etc.), land-atmosphere-ocean interactions, and the North American Monsoon system. She has also worked on national- and local- scale extreme temperature projects. One of the projects Kerrie hopes to accomplish during her time as a postdoc at ARS is a climate model evaluation tool to make the process of model ensemble selection (e.g. which downscaled models should be excluded from your analyses due to the garbage in garbage out principle) simpler and quicker for research scientists.
