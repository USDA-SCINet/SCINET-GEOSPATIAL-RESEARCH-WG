**At last year's workshop we:**
- heard from ARS scientists about successes and challenges of using SCINet for geospatial analysis, 
- identified common issues and barriers to using SCINet for geospatial research workflows,
- generated recommendations for overcoming these issues/barriers, 
- created the SCINet Geospatial Research Working Group to follow through with workshop recommendations, and
- learned about machine learning, deep learning, and some of the ways ML/DL are being used for research at New Mexico State University and the Jornada Experimental Range.


**Computational Needs of the ARS Geospatial Research Community:**
- data access, sharing, and storage
  - securely store data
  - rapid access to data
  - share large data files that aren't publicly available
  - make research data publicly assessible (distribution and archiving)
  - access to AgCROS and PDI data servers from SCINet
- reproducibility and collaboration
  - improve data provenance and versioning
  - collaborate on models and code development in real time
- computation and data manipulation
  - explore/visualize large data
  - build capacity for using SCINet/HPC and knowing when to use
  - cloud computing and storage for operational projects with large input and output data
  - decision support/agro-informatics applications for our stakeholders


**Recommendations for improving access to SCINet HPC/cloud computing and enhancing general computational skill in the ARS geospatial research community:**

<br><br>

### Preparation for the tutorial sessions (2, 3, 4, 5)

The most important item is **make sure you can successfully login to your SCINet account** before (preferably days before) the tutorials start. There are many tutorial registrants with expired passwords that may need assistance from the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) if old passwords have been forgotten. If it's your first time logging in, use the [Quick Start Guide](https://scinet.usda.gov/guide/quickstart) and if you are still having trouble and contact the VRSC for help scinet_vrsc@usda.gov.

Try to **set yourself up on a large monitor** or Google how to connect your laptop to your tv. Ideally, you will want enough screen space to have a side by side set up where one side is the live Zoom session and the other side you can have JupyterLab open in a browser window so you can work through the tutorials in real time. This set up is nearly impossible on a laptop screen alone.

If you plan to follow along with the Git/Github portion of the Session 4 Tutorial: Computational Reproducibility Tools, **[Create a free personal Github account](https://github.com/join)**.  Make sure you remember your Github username and password.

Lastly, visit the [premeeting page](/SCINET-GEOSPATIAL-RESEARCH-WG/content/0-PreMeeting.html) to **familiarize yourself with the software/HPC terminology that will be used** in the tutorial sessions.
<br><br>

### Other Upcoming Activities of the Working Group

We're planning to hold a working group Zoom session quarterly at minimum (monthly if we have enough content ideas). The sessions could be research presentations from inside or outside ARS, short tutorials or demonstrations of software or computational techniques, and presentations such as how to design collaborative research, how to make better scientific figures/presentations, HPC etiquette, etc. We will also have sessions on our ongoing projects such as the SCINet common data library and the geospatial workbook.

**Discussion Question: What content would you like to see in quarterly working group meetings?**

## Working Session: SCINet Common Data Library

Lead: Yanghui Kang, SCINet Postdoc

During the 2019 SCINet Geospatial Workshop, the working group identified the need to develop a shared repository to serve commmonly used geospatial datasets to ARS users. The common data library/repository aims to enable easy access to popular datasets and reduce the barrier of adoption for SCINet HPC clusters. Before the 2020 SCINet Geospatial Workshop, we invited the working group and workshop participants to complete a survey about the data and computational needs of ARS geospatial researches and applications. In this session, we will present the preliminary results of the survey and discuss important aspects of the common data library development.

**Tentative Agenda**
* Brief introduction (5 mins)
* Preliminary results of the SCINet Geospatial Data and Computational Needs Survey (10 mins)
* Discuss (45 mins)
  * What kind of datasets and which ones will be stored on the clusters?
  * How to store, manage, and serve data to the users?
  * How to allow easy access to data that does not make it to the library/repository?
  * Other topics brought by the audience ...
