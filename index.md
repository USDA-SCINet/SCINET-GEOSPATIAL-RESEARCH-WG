# SCINet Geospatial Workshop 2020

**Harnessing SCINet computational resources in geospatial data science to further sustainable and intensified agriculture.**

*Hosted By: SCINet Geospatial Research Working Group with support from [USDA ARS, SCINet Scientific Computing Initiative](https://scinet.usda.gov/)*

<br>
# Goals

The 2020 SCINet Geospatial Workshop continues the efforts outlined from the 2019 workshop held in Las Cruces, NM. The two overarching goals of this workshop are to:

  1. provide hands-on learning experiences (tutorials) on workflows to access the Ceres high-performance computing (HPC) system and conduct geospatial and machine learning research at scale,
  2. foster research efforts that had previously been un-attainable due to computational limitations or technical bottleknecks. This includes developing infrastructure and exploring state-of-the-art machine learning methods applicable to geospatial sciences.

# How to Participate

**All members of the working group as well as non-members from USDA ARS are welcome to participate!** We also welcome our University collaborators who have USDA SCINet accounts. We are hoping that everyone will attend the general session of the working group ([Session 1](#session-1-annual-meeting-of-the-scinet-geospatial-research-working-group)) and then pick and choose other sessions to attend based on your own interests and skill level.

The workshop is split over 6 separate Zoom sessions (as well as a pre-meeting assistance session) that will include:
  - computational infrastructure and resource development for the ARS geospatial research community (e.g. the common data library and the geospatial workbook), 
  - hands-on tutorials to assist researchers in utilizing the Ceres HPC system, and 
  - research presentations from successful efforts using machine learning to address agricultural issues.
  
**To follow along with the tutorials you need to already have or [apply for a SCINet account](https://scinet.usda.gov/signup/) and be able to successfully login to your account. We recommend applying for an account by 8/12/2020 at the latest**, as the process can take 1-2 weeks for final approval. Please note, if you need help accessing your SCINet account you should plan on attending the pre-meeting login assistance session on 8/19/2020 (Session 0), but make sure you have applied for an account well in advance of this session.

**To follow along with the Session 4 Tutorial: Computational Reproducibility Tools make sure you** [**create a Github account**](https://github.com/join) for yourself and remember your Github username and password. You will also, of course, need a SCINet account as described above.

**Please register for each session individually** using the registration links below so we can have an idea of how many people will be present at each event. Note, each session will have a separate Zoom link and password so you must register for each session you would like to attend.

**Lastly, review the pre-meeting checklist and background information on the [Pre-meeting page](/SCINET-GEOSPATIAL-RESEARCH-WG/content/0-PreMeeting.html) to ensure you are prepared for the workshop sessions.**

<br>
# Schedule / Registration

**Note: All workshop sessions are open to all scientists and scientific staff at USDA ARS. We also welcome ARS contractors and University collaborators who have a SCINet account. Please make sure to register separately for each session you plan on attending (the Zoom join details are different for each session).**

The Conda portion will cover how to access or install Conda on Ceres, how to use Conda to download software on Ceres, how to use Conda environments to document all the software you are using and eliminate dependency issues, and how to save your Conda environment details to a specification file so that you can quickly recreate your complete software environment for any project. We will also cover how containers can allow your codes to run successfully on different operating systems, how to use (and create) a Docker image, and how to use Singularity on the Ceres HPC to run a container from a Docker image.

We will not cover basic linux, how to login to your SCINet account, or troubleshoot individual account access problems during this session. If you are having trouble accessing your account please plan to attend Session 0. If you need basic linux help or are new to working in an HPC environment please plan to first attend Session 2.

This interactive follow-along tutorial uses a machine learning gradient boosting model (XGBoost) to predict NDVI (Harmonized Landsat Sentinel) from daily weather (PRISM) and physiologic variables (soil properties) at the Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER) Long Term Agro-ecosystem Research station. Participants will use their own SCINet account to walk through a Jupyter Notebook and execute Python code on the Ceres HPC system.

The workflow involves:<br>
- Setup a cluster on Ceres (Dask Distributed)<br>
- Read data and interpolate onto a consistent grid (Xarray, Dask Dataframe)<br>
- Merge/shuffle/split the data (Dask_ML, Scikit Learn)<br>
- Optimize the hyperparameters (Dask_ML, Scikit Learn, XGBoost)<br>
- Train a distributed XGBoost model (Scikit Learn, XGBoost, Dask Distributed, datashader)<br>
- Quantify the accuracy and visualize the results (Scikit Learn, SHAP)

We will not cover basic Python, basic distributed/parallel computing, how to login to your SCINet account, or troubleshoot individual account access problems during this session. If you are having trouble accessing your account please plan to attend Session 0. If you have limited experience working on an HPC system we recommend first attending Sessions 2 and 3.

This session is for USDA ARS scientists, scientific staff, and University collaborators who are interested in learning about how machine learning is being used in agricultural research. We will have 4 invited speakers from outside of USDA ARS give talks about using maching learning for a range of agricultural research questions, followed by a panel discussion. 

**AGENDA (MDT)**

**11-11:10    Drs Yanghui Kang & Amy Hudson, USDA-ARS SCINet Postdocs**

  - Welcome

**11:10-11:40   Dr Matthew Jones, University of Montana**

  - Predicting rangeland fractional cover for the western U.S. with random forests and multitask learning

**11:45-12:15   Dr Liheng Zhong, Descartes Labs**

  - How to use statistical data to train classifiers

**12:20-12:50   Dr Vasit Sagan, Saint Louis University**

  - UAV-satellite spatio-temporal data fusion and deep learning for yield prediction

**12:55-1:25    Dr Jingyi Huang, University of Wisconsin**

  - Characterizing field-scale soil moisture dynamics with big data and machine learning: challenges and opportunities for digital agriculture

**1:30-1:40   Short Break**

**1:40-2:15   Panel Discussion**

- What are the merits and pitfalls of machine learning techniques in comparison to traditional deterministic (physical/process-based) and probabilistic modeling/analysis for agricultural research?
- The USDA ARS is currently undergoing an effort to increase/improve the computational and machine learning capabilities across the agency. What are the skillsets that are required to conduct research with “big data” using machine learning techniques? Do you have suggestions on the best approaches for developing these skillsets?
- What do you see as the future directions for machine learning and advanced computing techniques (e.g. cloud, HPC) in agricultural research?
