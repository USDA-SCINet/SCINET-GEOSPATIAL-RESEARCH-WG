## SCINet Geospatial Workshop (2020)

{% include figure.html img="usda_symbol_rgb_color.svg" alt="intro image here" caption="" width="100%" %}

**Theme:** Harnessing SCINet computational resources in geospatial data science to further sustainable and intensified agriculture.

**Hosted By** [USDA ARS, SCINet Scientific Computing Initiative](https://scinet.usda.gov/), {{ site.pub_year }}.

**Abstract:** The 2020 SCINet Geospatial workshop continues the efforts outlined from the 2019 workshop held in Los Cruces, NM. The two overarching goals of this workshop are to:

  1. provide hands-on learning experiences (tutorials) on workflows to access Ceres and conduct geospatial and machine learning research at scale.
  2. foster research efforts that had previously been un-attainable due to computational limitations or technical bottleknecks. This includes develop infrastructure or exploring state-of-the-art machine learning methods applicable to geospatial sciences.

The workshop will cover topics such as developing infrastructure and resources required by the geosptial community (e.g. the common data library and the geospatial workbook), providing hands-on tutorials to assist researchers to utilize Ceres, the ARS HPC system, and present research from successfuly efforts using machine learning to address agricultural issues.

Following this workshop, SCINet geospatial ORise fellows will be leading specific research efforts, each with a dedicated workshop, to address a specific research question.
